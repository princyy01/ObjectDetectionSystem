In this project, we present an Object Detection System designed to detect and localize objects within images using the VOC dataset format.

Model Architecture:

1. XML Parser: The XmlParser class is responsible for parsing XML annotation files associated with the VOC dataset. It extracts information such as image paths, image IDs, class names, and bounding box coordinates.

2. Dataset Class: The VOCDataset class extends the PyTorch Dataset class and is tailored for the VOC dataset. It loads images and annotations, preprocesses them, and provides them in a format suitable for training object detection models.

3. Data Preprocessing: Images are loaded using OpenCV and converted to RGB format. They are then normalized to values between 0 and 1. Bounding box coordinates and class labels are extracted from the XML annotations and prepared in a format compatible with PyTorch.

4. Data Augmentation: The dataset class supports optional data augmentation techniques through transforms. These transformations can include random rotations, flips, and color adjustments, enhancing the model's robustness and generalization capability.

Training Procedure:

1. Data Loading: The VOCDataset class loads images and annotations from the VOC dataset, making them accessible for training.

2. Model Construction: An object detection model, such as Faster R-CNN or SSD, is constructed using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow. This model is designed to predict bounding boxes and class labels for objects within images.

3. Model Training: The constructed model is trained using the annotated images and their corresponding ground truth bounding boxes. Training involves optimizing the model's parameters using techniques like stochastic gradient descent or Adam optimization.

4. Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its performance in terms of metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), Intersection over Union (IoU), and accuracy. This evaluation helps gauge the model's ability to accurately detect and localize objects in unseen images.
